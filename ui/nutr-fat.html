<h2>Fats and Oils </h2>
<br>
<body>
<p>Fats and oils should provide about 10-15% fat in a healthy diet. The time when fats and oil in a diet 
is harmful is when they are allowed to eat excessive fat and calories without proper exercise to balance things out.
Fats provide energy, makes food tastier, promote a healthy heart, and keep your dog's coat healthy
and shiny.
</p>
<ul>

<li>
Essential fatty acids are divided into two groups called omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Fat are important components in 
the production of hormone-like substances called prostaglandins which works to reduce inflammation. Fats and oils give structure to foods 
and help the body absorb certain vitamins such as A, D, E, and K. 
</li>

<li>
Avoid lower-quality ingredients such as beef tallow or lard.
</li> 

<li>
Look for where the fats and oils are coming from in the list of ingredients. Fats in dog food are supplied by animal fat and oils from plants.
Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are usually listed in quality dog foods. These fatty acids help promote heart health, skin and coat, and optimal brain function.
</li>

</ul>
<p>
Fish oils such as herring or salmon and flaxseed and canola oils are sources of omega-3 fatty acids.
Pork fat, chicken fat, safflower and sunflower oils, corns, vegetable oils are considered omega-6 fatty acid.
